This is not, but mostly a laidback feedback, motivated by another presentation at MixIT, by the community manager of lichess.org. It&#39;s a repository of ideas, remarks, to help others not to repeat the same mistakes that I&#39;ve done in those last 4 years.</p>
<h2>GMP3&#39;s end gave birth to TN.</h2><p>GMP3 was a website directed by a technical team and some newsers, but which was letting users create the content through a relatively free guideline. The blog being the only exception as it was also fed by interns. Basically, TN started when GMP3&#39;s technical just stopped listening to users and ignoring any demands.</p>
<p>Started by Florian as a simple forum, based upon GMP3&#39;s organization (without the economic part thanks to a cheap server), I started as a newser with the goal to become &quot;something&quot; in this brand new project, which goal was to start again a French audiophile community. At that time, Gwendal was the second in charge, being more engaged on the communication with the community whereas Florian was more into the technical aspects. The organizational structure was pretty simple : a single staff that whoever could join if he wanted to be a part of it. There was then multiples profiles identified : the animators as intermediaries with the community, moderators, well, to moderate the forums; the newsers as the one in charge of creating content for the blog; the testers, which would write some quality product feedback usable for the blog and finally the admins. Every decisions were taken by this small team and could have an impact over the whole website.</p>
<p>Time being, Gwendal took over Florian, whereas I swapped from newser to tech. The staff became more inclined to have a relationship with the community, asking for feedback through the Bugs and suggestions  pages. I consider having my part of influence in this, as it&#39;s a part of my vision of a community : opening and letting the community use the website as a free support for their content. However, my actions were limited as it made me look more as a linuxian hipster, as I wasn&#39; t taking the time to explain that the organization from GMP3 shouldn&#39;t be reproduced as it failed already : we should keep access to a limited amount of people in order to create a durable and autonomous community instead of a closed team
&quot;all-doing&quot; team.</p>
<h3>The staff during my time</h3><p>Gwendal left us the way Florian did : absent, gone doing something else. It&#39;s partly because of this that I&#39;m currently writing those chronicles, to avoid repeating what have been done for the next one to come.</p>
<p>In the first place, my vision of the staff was relatively the same, to the exception that I was recruiting people with potential instead of waiting for a hypothetical investment. The idea was then to invite members to create quality content (the way testers were doing it) by furnishing canvas to help them. What happened in the end is that by identifying a group of active people, the normal members were in a position of awaiting from them instead of a personal investment based upon the testers&#39;  knowledge.</p>
<p>The other drawback of this team is the crystallizing of the staff members in the community : as clearly identified , their  point of view were considered as &quot;more legitimate&quot; to any other normal member, whereas the only difference was them being a part of a organized collaboration. The renewal of this team became more and more complex, as per their influence and their position, excluding them back to a simple membership wouldn&#39;t be without side-effects. Without clear objectives (in term of quantity), who&#39;s legitimate enough to consider in a flat hierarchy who shouldn&#39;t be a part of the team anymore ? We were all volunteers, on which basis can you blame somehow taking out of his time?</p>
<p>In this same logic of durability, vic, Poka and I created an association. To start with, we didn&#39;t put any responsibility upon it, except to have a legal face to communicate with brands and resellers and to receive legal donations to handle the server. The roles defined for the association were mainly senseless as it was a duplicate from what we had in a informal way inside the team or just to fill mandatory legal roles (president of the association and accountant).
Facing this inefficiency, a &quot;coup d&#39;état&quot; (in French in the text :)) was started. Composed of the more active members of the staff and sharing a common vision of what should be TN, the goal was to get out of this stasis. To do so, the main idea was to revoke the team membership, remove the team itself and delegate everything to the association. As it, and by the association rules, the missions per roles were somehow defined and time-limited (1 year, legally speaking).</p>
<p>As you can expect from a &quot;coup d&#39;état&quot;, the transition with non-informed staff members was rough, and they felt excluded (which was the case, sometimes judged non-capable to accept the idea to start-over, or simply because not able to communicate properly most of the time). It wasn&#39;t easy, but it was a necessary evil. The whole structure of the association was still debatable each year when electing a president, giving a real right to speak and make the association evolve through its members : a sortof online democracy, and a bit less of a centralized doocracy. In the first place, the association doesn&#39;t do much more than what we used to do in this team, but is way more stable and organized.</p>
<p>This was a bit of the evolution of the structure of TN, but still an introduction to different, random topics that I want to cover. I&#39;ll speak in my name, to avoid generalization and to put it into the context of &quot;what I see, understand and want&quot;. Whatever I may say, it&#39;s not a finished state that cannot evolve, but more of an issue in a specific context. I probably won&#39;t say everything (for those who were here with me at some point) as I don&#39;t hold a &quot;grudge&quot; over every issue I face : don&#39;t be afraid to ask for more details if you feel something&#39;s missing.</p>
<h2>TN, my values and my objectives</h2><p>TN had, from its different leaders, some varying values. Florian&#39;s action transformed into a paternalism which forced us to move into a new domain name : we moved from tellementnomade.com to tellementnomade.org . He gave it back afterwards, but we couldn&#39;t afford another domain name rolling in term of SEO.
The same happened for ads : initially in place to support the website, I removed them all considering it was a non-assured way to make money (and somehow retarded : the predominance of ad-blocker is a clear display of a sick market). I always wanted to make of TN a reference, something durable ,  independent and visible. On the sharing/community side, I think I&#39;ve been able to transmit it and anchor it deep enough to in worst case scenario, gather the pro-active people. It&#39;s about the &quot;visibility&quot; aspect that I have the most difficulty to be understood : I interpreted the lack of interest of the member by a lack of ROI on their side, which I linked to the lack of readers of the articles.</p>
<p>I then tried to bring readibility through graphics ( notations ) instead of text, allowing us to be referenced with Idealo, which never been applied. I oriented the technical development to be SEO friendly, tried to orient my argumentation upon statistics instead of using my personal point of view. It degraded my image as of human inside the community, to look more as &quot;result-oriented&quot; person instead of doing it &quot;for the greater good&quot;, losing by this way friend I had previously who would normally support me in those processes. It could be my will to make TN grow. One of the actual solution deployed is to &quot;gamify&quot;, and/or offering gifts/vouchers for &quot;qualified participation&quot;, through badges to actual giveaway, but I was against the first for several reasons :</p>
<h3>Titles, egos &amp; communitarism</h3><p>One of the strangest thing in community is the fact that it&#39;s based upon people, and pair-recognition. One of the reasons why there has been problems during the staff to association transition is because we revoked the status of testers. Some may say it was just an ego problem, but I really needed this reset of user titles. One of those reasons is because you can&#39;t judge of the quality of a tester  : we can easily demonstrate that the quantity of model owned doesn&#39;t guarantee his capacity to listen, transmit and criticize objectively.</p>
<p>Another reasons is that users (and not only testers) point of view was based upon  their passive experience, their title and the number of posts. By this, there is a sort of violence towards new members who are supposed to be ignorant, when they actually oppose a &quot;known member&quot;. It evens goes to derivative strategy as &quot;he has been there longer so he knows more&quot; or how to support a &quot;known member&quot; to be well seen; or &quot;I have more posts so stfu and go back to /b&quot;.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t let this continue this way, it&#39;s a latent cancer that could let a community die by limiting the point of view to the dominant one. By removing the titles and posts numbers, I&#39;d hope for a reduction of these acts. I think it did, but we also lost (for some time at least) the people who were participating, for the ego/pair-recognition.</p>
<h3>Growing ?</h3><p>When I wrote in the first place, it was after being at Mix-IT, a regroupement for conferences which ended-up with a question : &quot;Do you want to grow?&quot;. After thinking about it, I considered a &quot;No&quot;.
I think it comes from the fear to grow facing the will to grow. If you want to grow, you need to be able to face it, all the changes that comes with. You need to lead the fucking changes, and I&#39;m far from a &quot;front-facing&quot; leader.</p>
<h2>The association</h2><p>There has been a negative remarks regarding the role of the association : it has been creating a lot of tensions through &quot;debates&quot;, or its virulence. The association brang 2 things : role definition and the weight (and power) of its member in decision making, in a formal way.</p>
<h3>Defining roles, and respecting them</h3><p>Once again, we are unpaid workers, et nobody can pretend to say he&#39;s working harder than another, or deserve more attention than another. This rework of the definition changed the organization in its structure : here, we actually changed from a single team to sortof independent poles. Once again, not everybody has been happy with this change, by the lack of (again) quantifiable objectives, and for others to be a part of a organized group (and then lose their independence and unicity), making them unable to participate directly.</p>
<p>Facing those 2 scenarii, I&#39;ve found no way to solve it : definition is unlimited by design, and it&#39;s a balance to find in between guidelines and rules : one helps, the others enforce. With volunteers, I really doubt that setting fixed and strict &quot;way to do&quot; is a rewarding and efficient way to motivate people, where I would expect people invest themselves if they want to.</p>
<p>Structuring without restricting, basically.</p>
<h2>Words, and virulence</h2><p>We face(d) the same issue that the Pirate Party is having in France : everybody want to be right, and consider to be. In this particular scenario, TN was leaderless (formly announced at least) and even with a voted program, there was nobody to apply it (somehow looks like our actual politician :)). In this case, the moderation was a though job : to which point can you consider that it&#39;s over the rules, and when ad hominem attacks were justifiable, or not. It&#39;s was often the one occupying most of the debate which was listened to, instead of the one with actual arguments. There was, by definition, no debate, as the speech was monopolized by 2, 3 people, frightening anybody trying to get through their way, to which point the &quot;debate&quot; was in stasis. This stasis was often ending by a situation where nobody was actually acting on the final decisions : because everybody was so tired of debating, or because the choice made was &quot;meh&quot;, creating some more frictions that nobody wanted but was just a way to win a debate.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this comes from the restriction of free-speech (moderation), a side-effect from this organization change,  the lack of leadership (to cut through the debatable and the non-), or a simple quest for personal recognition (or political placement, who cares? ) . It&#39;s kinda hard to say that it&#39;s a moderation job, as it goes over the validity and building process of having a dialog instead of a confrontation, so that a mediator role could be of use in this cases. It&#39;s even more difficult for moderation when the actual subject is about ... moderation itself ;)</p>
<h2>Rules, freedom and flexibility</h2><p>The association shipped a bunch of rules which weren&#39;t existing before. This rules however need to be flexible. In complex cases that are &quot;over the rules&quot; likely the administration of the association itself, it&#39;s way more efficient to be able to &quot;be human&quot; over to apply rules in order to not block people in an administrative loop : some choices are to be made without necessary consulting all the association, moving the bank account, moving the domain hosting, etc.
By definition, those moves should go through a general meeting, whereas people doesn&#39;t necessarily knows why we&#39;re doing it or does it work (try to explain DNS for a domain migration to 100 ppl without technical background, through the internet only (and who doesn&#39;t necessarily care about it)).</p>
<p>The same goes for moderation again : when a case is not defined by the rules, is the reactivity more important than following a (often long) workflow? For something as critical as moderation, I&#39;d go the fastness over the ruling of the rules, to avoid a bad experience for the users.</p>
<h2>Sustainability and technical architecture</h2><p>My most visible objective was sustainability : the power has been diluted to avoid Single Point Of Failure (SPOF), of being dependent of only one person. There is an existing theory considering that Internet&#39;s product are technology-driven : if there are maintained permanently (on a subject not being totally crazy) the product will meet its market, its users at some point.
This is more about creating the market instead of using an existing one. As an example, GMP3 died because it wasn&#39;t maintained technically anymore, leading to a lack of completion between what was existing and user needs. Even though it may not be eternal, the fact to listen to music through headphones, or IEMs (or whatever the future holds for us) will still be something.
If the members are following the trends of evolution, the website, if maintained, need to follow. Else what the member will simply fork the project/community to accommodate it to their trends.</p>
<p>I think the real difficulty here is to be able to find people able to invest themselves on such a long time, and not only technology oriented, but user oriented. As any client, you&#39;ll hear more about complaints than happiness. On TN, the platform is quite dependant from my knowledge, and that&#39;s a real weak point.</p>
<p>I said, also, that tech need to listen to their users. That&#39;s right, but for sustainability matter, it also need to be &quot;out&quot; of the structure.
The reason is simple : the inner organization may fail (the leading team, the association), but the support can be valid, so that it can reborn from what have been done without starting from scratch, again; and then surviving to the multiple clashes and coup d&#39;état that may happen.</p>
<h2>Independence &amp; brand reputation, from the product to the member</h2><p>Multiples issues for this title : to keep the independence from the brands as a brand ourselves, and inside the community.
Nanotechnos was one former team member, as a blogger. After some time, he opened an online shop to import some audio gear, using the forum as a support to sell, find clients and promote his own products. Of course, we didn&#39;t see that right away, naive as we are. This is the kind of people, abusing a system that we can find as a pain in the ass for anybody claiming to be independent : when advices are based upon availability in his shop.
Audiogarden isn&#39;t the only brand, reseller on the website, we have AudioTechnica, Audiophonics or Focal , but they know how to communicate without abusing their status.</p>
<p>On the member side, we can also think of Vic or Benjisun, among others, who suffered the opposite way : their independence (or lack of transparency) lead to fanboy war and questioning regarding the independence of TN and their members.
By willing to create a strong link between the community and a brand, they&#39;ve been accused to be sold to this particular brand for years. A good example is the way TN&#39;s members are considered as snobs on HFR, a quite huge and generalist tech board owned by LDLC.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the opposite case, when a member claim to be from TN (and use our image) to get discount, offer in our name without telling anybody or returning anything to the community. We can only hope for the brand to come back to us, and trust us : we can&#39;t know everything.</p>
<h2>Regarding forking, or to startaganitwillbebetterIpromise</h2><p>I really need to speak about a website, call tupperwav. Sincerely, this was the first core of the team that was working well. Maybe am I still a bit nostalgic about it, as it corresponds to my start as an administrator, but their will to be implied led them to go away.
I think we lost something because of this, some good members probably. They ended forking without foreseeing the problem of sustainability on the Internet : the project died 6/8 months after, the small team of 5 people being not motivated enough to continue, seeing all their effort reduced to &quot;lost scripts&quot; on the web.
I don&#39;t know what really went wrong : I never been stopping initiatives, and this project could have been a part of TN, but it seems they considered it wasn&#39;t possible for them, and considering how I reacted to their &quot;forking as a treason&quot;, it sure didn&#39;t help communicating.</p>
<h2>Of the difficulty to define a review, and the quality of a review</h2><p>There is (at least) 2 category of people : audiophiles who trusts what they hear (subjectivists), and technophiles who trust the measures (objectivists). The latter would like to create protocols to compare some stuff and the first rely on their experience.</p>
<p>As it, on a SEO matter, I tried to enforce a notation for review in order to have our tests easier to read for neophytes. Of course, how can you put a rule based upon a notation if you don&#39;t have proper criterias (technophiles) and why would you do that in any way (audiophiles). Even an in-between seems unresolvable for them, not enough or too much.</p>
<p>The same issue has been seen when we tried to offer a model for the test, more as a guideline on &quot;how to write a complete review&quot; than a &quot;must do or refused&quot;,  it never worked, really. First of all, people seems to dislike to be told how to do, and then &quot;Is the structure/content defining the separation between a feedback and a review&quot; ? In which case, if the structure (and the completion of its content) is not the main difference between those two, it&#39;s to actually judge of the quality of its content.
Based on ? Writing style ? The writer&#39;s experience? His efficient usage of words?</p>
<p>To that point, what&#39;s the point of making a visible split ? Because the reviewer is more egocentric than the feedbacker? Maybe. Maybe it&#39;s just simpler to merge those two into one, and then simplify the vocabulary.</p>
<h2>How to retain active members</h2><p>Another issue I&#39;ve been working on was to retain members, to make them integrate the core members for the community to evolve, and avoid a stasis. It&#39;s quite hard on our &quot;market&quot; : people most of the time are just looking for an answer to buy a new gear, and once found, just go away (until, sometimes, next time).</p>
<p>If they stay and come back, it&#39;s because the advice&#39;s been good and they want their gear to evolve again. Mailing seems to be a failure on that point : you either like techno-based communities or you don&#39;t, aka you&#39;re a fan or you&#39;re not, no point in calling back.
And since we don&#39;t offer much more than our knowledge, we don&#39;t have much of an attraction.</p>
<h2>Classified Ads and visibility, how to deal with a subforum as the main attraction for new members</h2><p>When the most visited part of the forum is member advertising, it becomes hard to control. The main reason is simply that it touches the 1rst world problem, our relation to money. The difficulty then resides in a balance between freedom, quality, ease of moderation to stay attractive for members.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to handle risks : how to avoid or at least, reduce scam? Our first case was not at his first try, creating account with more than 200 posts before scamming people.
The ip address has been recognized (by me) as useless, and so were emails as a restriction. Reddit implemented a quite nice alternative known as &quot;shadow-ban&quot; which let the banned posts but nobody can see their messages. Alas, it doesn&#39;t exists on phpbb.</p>
<p>Another solution proposed was to limit the access to certain members, which is obviously pointless regarding the previous example, this guy coming back with more than 5 accounts ~200 posts : and you&#39;ll repeat by giving this example multiple times, by people thinks they know better than you, and that the simple solution (which is theirs) is always the best one. The impact of this solution would be even worse, it means you actually cut out what brings you visibility, and so, the renewal of your community with new members.</p>
<p>We can easily do a parallel with the state of software security at that point, where the risk is measured by the complexity to bypass the rule, and not the possibility to reach a risk 0.</p>
<p>The main measures we took to handle this section was to define 2 kind of rules : one being a mandatory post template in order to organize the posts and insure it contains all the necessary data to be &quot;relatively assured&quot;, or at least knowing the risk you&#39;re taking; and the other rule being usage rule specifics to this board. Enforced by the moderators, it&#39;s also the n°1 issue : the rules, while defined by the members themselves, are applied only when they wish to. We can easily see <translate> trying to make the rule applied to others when they don&#39;t do it themselves...</translate></p>
<p>This part of the forum is also a source of debate regarding income. Considering it&#39;s the most active one, it&#39;s also an indicator of the medium price the members use to pay for their gear, and so of the pricing we could put on our service. However, if people actually like our services, it&#39;s also because it&#39;s free : don&#39;t tax it the way France does as a solution to financing. When it&#39;s your user gateway, try to keep it clean and cozy.</p>
<h2>To show off, or act in intelligence and in an efficient way</h2><p>This is far from being new, and not only applicable to communities : some people are in need of reactivity which doesn&#39;t fit to the event. Let&#39;s put a context on this : a crisis for xyz reason happened, the consequences are unalterable and cannot go wrong further, the need to create a new rule to handle this is strong, because the event is still very present in people&#39;s head. With an event moral, like an insult or a scam, the need to show off that we are all ears is strong, and so is the need to legislate it, to make &quot;justice&quot;.
However consider something strong, unlikely to happen again, and doesn&#39;t have any signification on long term. How to react to this ? Likely you&#39;ll have to take it for yourself and let it be forgotten, because you can&#39;t do much more than communication, whereas people will still want &quot;justice&quot; to be done.</p>
<p>That&#39;s basically what I describe in the verbal violence of the association : whatever will you do, you&#39;ll be too slow, and the simple solution they propose will still be necessary to their eyes.
Simple cases applied to this story would probably be the renewal of a closed staff, or the over-recurrent discussions regarding ads. Both of them showed up to be inefficient as an overall solution, but comes back regularly to the front scene.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2><p>Moderation is a complex matter. One of the first thing I&#39;ve been doing on Internet was moderation of a wargame board ( ex-Artgamer). It&#39;s a role which confronts your values, your friendship and your honesty. Whatever decision you make, you&#39;ll be criticized.</p>
<p>It requires a strong will to be able to shut down topics which are becoming insane and resists the call to just have a never-ending argument which would tear down your image. This comes to an issue regarding communitarism, this group tending to close itself to protect themselves from this criticism.</p>
<p>The only way so far to contain this was to define rules.
Those rules contains what should not be done, not necessary what is the counterpart to it. Defining the punition would remove the freedom of judging to the moderation (which would then could be automated).</p>
<p>Same goes with penalties, defining any misbehavior with their penalties according to your previous records and the multiples causes of the event would be a simple madness that noone want to read, or apply. I really consider that an externalization to the normal processes of the staff is required, for them to be independent of the processes to avoid conflicts of interests, which means to keep some kind of shared mentality to avoid internal clashes while letting an exceptional scenario possible in case of abuse.</p>
<h2>Communautarism &amp; localization</h2><p>TN is based upon a simple position : it&#39;s a french comunity with a french-speaking influence. The impact of this position is a segmentarization into geographical regions, cities where people ends up meeting to discuss music with a drink, or two. It also leads to a better linking of people, being able to put a face on somebody&#39;s nickname, as well as creating clans.
In example, if one member is being reprimanded by the moderation, there is a risk that this whole clan is going to react to defend the user, claiming the moderation is unfair.</p>
<p>That simply demonstrate the lack of &quot;emotions&quot; Internet carries, a thing a drink can solve, with side-effects. ;)</p>
<h2>Me, from newser to administrator</h2><h3>Taking over</h3><p>When I started, I just wanted to be helpful, in any way I could. I&#39;ve then been newsing for ~6 months, to go back afterwards to my favorite activity, web dev. The first issue was to make available a stack of existing tools, instead of going for custom development.</p>
<h3>As administrator</h3><p>By admin, I mean &quot;Admin&quot;, not only taking care of administration, but also all powerful.
While I was discussing the matter with the staff, or the community, it was allowing us to make quick choices, while what mattered the most was to apply this decision. When you lead a group of inactives people, you&#39;re working alone. And with all the good will you could have, you still end up doing what you prefer.</p>
<p>I&#39;m no leader, but a facilitator, I prefer to help than push. This era demonstrates a technical stasis to refocus over content and the community.</p>
<h4>From delegating to disinterest</h4><p>My personal goals for development and my vision slowly faded away on those last years. For a simple reason : my objectives are too different from what the community wants. Though, , I&#39;d like not to throw away what has been and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been diluting power. It&#39;s not easy. When you&#39;ve got the habit to only rely on yourself, makes choices by yourself and you end up having people opinions upon a single subject, it get messy. The same way you could enforce a decision before because it seemed &quot;vital&quot;, you now need to validate it with 70 persons. Estaero, blog team&#39;s best shadow editor, paid the price when he tickled me with the notion of &quot;confidence into the administrator&quot; (me, no grudge taken here &lt;3 Esta) and understood that technically I could do whatever I wanted, and so did Herm2s when it came to the ownership of the bank account.
By delegating, it also gave me the opportunity to refocus on dev, leading us to a redesign of the whole stack, and some major updates. It was an overall positive experience and choice, giving to each of us more liberties and letting me focus on what I like, with one lose though : accepting that TN won&#39;t become what I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>I even thought that I could be what threatened TN, it&#39;s cancer. By pushing my vision without leading others, didn&#39;t I exhaust people&#39;s motivation? Those values I cherish, are they applicable to a community ? My goals reachable for this kind of community? My final idea of what was I doing was to be in the history of the Web or to work with others people, to understand their belief and acts, to dress this document on &quot;how to not to un-lead a community&quot; ?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have an answer for this, frankly. I participated into the creation of an undying monster pushed by the will of few and with a relation of love-hate by others, and I&#39;m definitely one of those source of conflict I&#39;ve been trying to avoid for the well-being of the association; due by this habit of power, my years of service, my position of &quot;what TN should have been&quot;.
I&#39;m still serving it by the time I speak, doing the minimum for it to continue, but without any capacity to make it evolve.</p>
<h1>What is TN nowadays?</h1><p>TN is an association which run with the volunteer capacity, those who can argue their choice without disturbing the established ones. It&#39;s a participative doocracy for the associative part, and a tyrannically administrated forum for some, too supple for others.</p>
<p>It&#39;s certainly one thing though : it&#39;s living people that&#39;ll discover during a meeting, with whom you&#39;ll share a beer, a song, a story.
Some you would love to forget from the pain it created, some you would love to live again, for all the good it gave.</p>
<h3>And me ?</h3><p>I&#39;m done, I guess. You could say it&#39;s a quite depressing assessment. That&#39;s both right and wrong. If you had to remember only one thing, it&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t wait anything from others that you could do by yourself&quot;.
I criticized a lot some people&#39;s behavior or processes to achieve their goals, because they didn&#39;t fit my ideology.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t listen to those people like me, and continue, we&#39;ll cross each other on the same path, at the very end.
Cheers,
W.</p></body></html>
